        Turquoise waters, towering mountains, beautiful lakes, and generous people, Skardu has it all. Spend a day or
        two exploring the beautiful Kachhura Village, Shangri-la Resort, and the sand dunes in Katpana village.

        Enjoy an incredible experience watching the sunrise and sunset over the Indus River. To know the area’s history,
        visit the 600 years old Kharpocho Fort.

        Shopping and dining in Skardu Bazaar is a must. Here you’ll find some fantastic local gifts for your friends and
        family back home.

        If you are fond of trekking, you can’t help trekking through the glaciers to the basecamps of some of the
        world’s highest mountains, including K2.

        Your vacation wouldn’t be complete without a visit to the surreal Deosai National Park and Satpara Lake.
