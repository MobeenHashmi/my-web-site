1. Differentiate arrow functions and regular functions.
Ans: There are some following difference between arrow and regular fucntions
	1.Syntax:
arrow function:  let add = (a,b) =>{}
regular function:  function sum (a,b){}
	2.The main difference between arrow and regular fuction is we can invoke the function add(2,3) before its declaration also, but the 	  function sum(2,3) needs to invoke after it is defined.
	3. Cannot be used as constructors: 
	   Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and will throw an error if you try to use the "new" keyword with them.
